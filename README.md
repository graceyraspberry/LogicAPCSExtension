# LogicAPCSExtension

Modified version of original logic project in C++!

# Differences:
The C++ classes have two files: a header, and a cpp file. The h. file defines all of the local variables and private and public method signatures. All of the methods are defined in the .cpp file. I documented each of the methods in the .cpp file, and changed some of the methods to have void return type so that they only modify the truthtable, and not return the entire truthtable. The only methods that return anything are the logical property ones which return a boolean of true or false according to whether the truthtable satisfies the requirements.
